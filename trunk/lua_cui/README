Lua Console User Interface
==========================

This library aims to provide a framework used by developers to
build console applications in pure Lua.

This framework was inspired in TVision[1] and most of the concepts
are modeled from it, although there is an attempt to take advantage
of the Lua language to do some things in a different way.

A curses back end is used to perform terminal operations, the rest
is done using only Lua.
